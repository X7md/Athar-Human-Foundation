                The programs and initiatives at Athar Humanitarian Foundation are designed to align with its vision and mission, inspired by the saying of Allah in Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 177:
            </p>
            <p class="my-6 text-xl font-watad leading-loose text-balance">
                "Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is in one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, and the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; and [who] establishes prayer and gives zakah; [who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous."
